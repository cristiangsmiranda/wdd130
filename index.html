          <p>Hello, my name is Cristian Gabriel Santiago Miranda and I'm from Salvador, Brazil.</p>
          <p> About my life:</p>
          <p>I'm passionate about reading, especially fantastic tales, and I love learning new things. I enjoy mathematical calculations and logical thinking games, and in a way, unlike most people I know, math is easy for me to understand. In my day-to-day life, when I'm not with my wife and daughter, I'm usually writing a fantasy novel or creating drawings of characters from books or manga. I speak Portuguese, Spanish and English, and my current goal is to learn Mandarin after I graduate in software development. I am religious and God-fearing and, among the things I am most grateful for in my life, I believe that being a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is one of the greatest privileges I have.</p>
